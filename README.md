- An API designed to enhance the reliability of UDP communications through a confirmed retransmission protocol.
- It functions more like a library than a standalone program.(So you don't have to know what's in the main.go file) The key strength lies in the implementation of the stable UDP API.
- The current state of the program leaves room for improvement, and I intend to enhance it as my understanding of computer networks continues to grow in the future.
