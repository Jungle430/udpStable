# UDP Stable

![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Network(udp)-GoLang-informational?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white&color=2bbc8a)

- An API designed to enhance the reliability of UDP communications through a confirmed retransmission protocol.
- It functions more like a library than a standalone program.(So you don't have to know what's in the main.go file) The key strength lies in the implementation of the stable UDP API.
- The current state of the program leaves room for improvement, and I intend to enhance it as my understanding of computer networks continues to grow in the future.

- command format

```shell
go run main.go <server|client> <port>
```

- port
  - For client is the destination port
  - For server is the listen port
